# Pages Directory

This directory contains **page-level React components** for the Local Business Website Evaluator frontend.

---

## Purpose

- Define full pages/views composed of smaller components
- Handle routing targets
- Manage page-specific logic and layout

---

## Key Pages

- `HomePage.jsx` — landing/search page
- `SearchPage.jsx` — search results
- `BusinessDetailPage.jsx` — detailed business info
- `ReportsPage.jsx` — reports and analytics

---

## Interaction with Other Components

- Use **components** to build UI
- Use **context** for global state
- Call **API services** for data

---

## Notes

- Each page should have a file header and JSDoc for props
- Keep pages under 200 lines; extract logic/components as needed
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
